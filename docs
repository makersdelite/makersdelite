*** Possible Pitfalls ***

---- IFRAME - ISSUES ----
  > clicks on inserted IFRAME content e.g. an SVG animation produced by inkscape based "sozi" presentation block subsequent mouse clicks of parent document within WebView2 - Control
  > WebView2 freezes completely after one single click on iframe's content. Therefore no iframe content at the moment
  > Event Propagation Issue
