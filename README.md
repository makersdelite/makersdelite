### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So. When it comes to replacement of old but beloved items such as WebBrowser control that nicely fits within my WindowsForms apps I'm stumbling around for hours integrating new brand new WebView2 control that has been propagated by it's well known creator at beginning of 2021.

Honestly spoken I'm really excited about the edgified chromium based WebView2 - control because despite the ancient WebBrowser control operates well I do have some unwanted side effects when it comes to modern svg animations like inkscape sozi based svg presentations and links clicked by users: svg animation simply - in my case - do not operate at all within IE11 based WebBrowser control. Additionally always IE11 opens when a user clicks on a link that resides in a HTML page within WebBrowser control even when WebBrowser control is lifted to a edgified visualisation.

This project simply collects information about an appropriate path getting successful regarding Windows Forms hybrid apps.
